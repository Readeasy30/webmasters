# Avatar System

This folder is the reusable avatar command center for Wholelychit websites.

## Rule

The marketing repo stores the reusable system, templates, and prompt library.

Each website repo stores its own finished avatar personality, final dialogue, embed notes, and page placement.

## Why this split works

- One shared workflow prevents repeated work.
- Each website keeps its own voice and audience fit.
- Large video files should not be stored in GitHub unless there is a clear reason.
- Finished videos should usually be hosted through YouTube, Canva, Cloudflare Stream, HeyGen, or another video platform, then embedded on the website.
